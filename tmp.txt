In a Bayesian regression modeling framework such as brms 
that uses a logit link, the logit function is typically 
used for modeling probabilities. The logit link transforms 
the probability (which ranges between 0 and 1) to the entire 
range of real numbers. This transformation facilitates the 
linear modeling of effects.

To transform the logit-scale estimates back to the natural 
probability scale (i.e., a scale from 0 to 1), you would use 
the logistic function, also known as the inverse logit function. 
This transformation is given by:

p=ex1+exp=1+exex​

where pp is the probability on the natural scale and xx is the logit-scale value.

To express pp in percentage terms, simply multiply the result by 100:

Percentage=(ex1+ex)×100Percentage=(1+exex​)×100

This transformation from the logit scale back to the probability scale is called the logistic transformation or sometimes simply the inverse logit.
